      <p>death note is known for it's creative plot and it's interesting theme of phychological horror. death note follows the protagonist, light yagami, a 17 year old highschool boy with a high intellegence. after school, he walks around campus, finding this notebook titled: death note. as he picks it up and reads it, he finds that the instructions say that if a name is written in the book, that person will die. thinking it's a joke, he doesnt believe it, but decides to test it out on a criminal anyway. after that criminal dies, he's shocked to find that the notebook isnt a joke, and that it's for real. after this discovery, he decides to use the death note to stop evil, to create a new world free of injustice.
        <p>a world class detective known as L decides to partake in this investigation and find out why all these criminals are suddenly dropping dead. light joins the task force with L to find what the cause of all these muders are, the person doing this called "kira" by the public. L knows that light is kira, but cant prove it, even going through harsh and injust ways to prove it. light knows that L will soon figure him out, but cant kill him because he doesnt know his real name. side by side, supposedly on the same team, they both try to figure eachother out.
